Originally, Archipel is a fitting project for the Media center Passage 44 (Brussels).

The space dedicated to it is divided into a web area, a listening area, a screening area. Tables, benches, chairs, side tables, storage cases and media wall display have been specially designed.

The furniture is based on the “do it yourself”, it incorporates some constructive principles designed by Gerrit Rietveld in the 30s, especially in its series CRATE. The small storage unit called “Gerrit” refers clearly to it.
