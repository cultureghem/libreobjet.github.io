title: About Libre Objet
content: |  
  Translation needed: As a group of industrial and graphic designers, hackers and artists, recently gathered together under the name Libre Objet, we all share a common question about open source industrial design, processes and products resulting from our work, with the aim of providing tools for accessing a free philosophy applied to the manufacture of objects.
