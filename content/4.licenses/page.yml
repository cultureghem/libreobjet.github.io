    ## A license? What for?
    
    By default (and in most cases), any creation is protected by law and the use of it requires permissions from its author(s). 
    
    If your intention, as a creator, is to share your work and call it a “libre objet”, it means that you want to allow any person to be able to study, copy, build, distribute and modify your design and to grant them these rights within a certain legal framework.
    
    We believe that by doing so, you increase your chances of getting your work known, promote a certain way of creating and prevent the possible misuses of it.
    
    ## What license to choose for your object?
    
    For your work to be considered a Libre Objet, you must publish it under a license that enforces the basic freedoms promoted by the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/).
    To help you in this matter, here is a list of licenses that we prefer and that we encourage you to use.  
      

    ### Free Art Licence

    ### OSHW
    There is also some specific open source hardware licenses available. You might have heard of the [TAPR OHL](http://www.tapr.org/ohl.html) or the [CERN OHL](http://www.ohwr.org/documents/294).
    We have never seen any furniture design released under these licenses. They are usually used for electronic hardware. But there is no reason they could not apply to any other kind of hardware design.
