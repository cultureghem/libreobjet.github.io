## About this website

This website was built using [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator. Which means that this website will also run from a usb key, a phone or a CD-ROM, without any software necessary other than a browser to view its content. You are encouraged to download a copy of it and deploy it wherever you see fit, as long as you don't change the license attached to it. All sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/libreobjet/libreobjet.org).

Any question, suggestions or ideas can be discussed on the GitHub’s [issue page](https://github.com/libreobjet/libreobjet.org/issues) or by [email](mailto:hello@libreobjet.org).

All the website content is under [Free Art License](http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en), except if stated otherwise.
